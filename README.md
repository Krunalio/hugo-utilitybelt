# hugo-utilitybelt
A theme consisting of partials that can be added as a theme component for any Hugo site

- `use-bootstrap4.html` is partial containing the CSS, javascript, and meta tags ideal for including bootstrap 4 (4.1.1 currently) in the `<head/>` tag of your site. This uses `async` loading of the scripts.
- `use_fontawesome5.html` is a partial for incorporating fontawesome 5 (5.1.0 currently) into your site.
- `use_fontawesome5pro.html` is a partial for incorporating fontawesome 5 (5.1.0 currently) Pro into your site. Note this won't work unless you've whitelisted your site with fontawesome.
